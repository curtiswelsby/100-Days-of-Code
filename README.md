# Day #0
I have set up my GitHub Repo for 100 days of code, Set up my Figma account for design.
For learning i will be using freecodecamp, Youtube, Odin Project and MDN.

# Day #1
Today I started with the development on my Portfolio website. I have created the folders and files required for the webpage. Set up the HTML file and started to add in content as well as styling. I have tried to create a logo using an online site i am not sure on the design but this will do for the time being and may return to change the design down the line.

# Day #2
I have decided to try and work more on the design on my Portfolio Website. I will be using Figma to do some design work. It has taken some time to get used to using Figma. I have reviewed some videos, and played around with the boxes and text to make it how i would like it.
I have more to complete in the coming days. once the design is complete i can start to work on the Code. See attached

# Day #4
Today I have been looking at designs and tutorials on CSS. Using Youtube Videos and google searches for design insporation for my portfolio.
With Youtube I have watched videos on CSS to get a better understanding of how it works and how to do things I would like to implement in my portfolio website + future projects.

# Day #5
Today has consisted of some more learning. I have done a few sections on FreeCodeCamp and some Youtube Videos on CSS tips and tricks.

# Day #6
I complete some more sections on free code camp. going over what I have done previously trying to develop my knowledge in both HTML and CSS. I have also watched some youtube videos on CSS and design to try and understand how i can design webpages better.

# Day #7
Today I have been looking at design. I want to develop my design knowledge and creativity so that I will be able to come up with different concepts and designs for customers. I have been using Youtube to find videos on Design which can help with understanding how design works.

# Day #8
I have been trying to get some more ideas around design. I really want my Portfolio to stand out. I have a better mind for development work and not as creative to come up with some fancy designs like I see from others. I am keen to try and get some ideas as to what i can do to stand out.

# Day #9
After the last few days of watching videos and trying to understand more about design i thought it best to get back to working on writing code. I have got back to doing some FreeCodeCamp. Going over some of the sections on HTML and CSS I have done before to try and refresh my mind on simple website building.

# Day #10
I feel like I have been watching videos and doing tutorials too much over the last few days. Back to try and start producing something. I think i need to just create my portfolio and some projects as that will put me in the best place to develop the most. Back to finishing the design of my website.
