Today I started with the development on my Portfolio website. I have created the folders and files required for the webpage. Set up the HTML file and started to add in content as well as styling. I have tried to create a logo using an online site i am not sure on the design but this will do for the time being and may return to change the design down the line.

I have decided to try and work more on the design on my Portfolio Website. I will be using Figma to do some design work. It has taken some time to get used to using Figma. I have reviewed some videos, and played around with the boxes and text to make it how i would like it.
I have more to complete in the coming days. once the design is complete i can start to work on the Code. See attached
