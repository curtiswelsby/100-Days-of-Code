# Day #0
I have set up my GitHub Repo for 100 days of code, Set up my Figma account for design.
For learning i will be using freecodecamp, Youtube, Odin Project and MDN.

# Day #1
Today I started with the development on my Portfolio website. I have created the folders and files required for the webpage. Set up the HTML file and started to add in content as well as styling. I have tried to create a logo using an online site i am not sure on the design but this will do for the time being and may return to change the design down the line.
